<h1>VISA FOR SRILANKA</h1>
<P1>Unlike many other Asian countries, Sri Lanka doesn’t offer a visa on arrival. However, you can apply for an electronic visa or eVisa.</p1>
 <p1>An eVisa is a double entry visa for 30 days, which is usually enough for most of the travelers. </P1><br>

<h1>THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL INTERNALLY IS BY TRAIN</h1>
 <P2>Picture this – you’re sitting in a cute train coach and everywhere you look, you see tea estates, forests, waterfalls, hills, monkeys.. and maybe even an elephant if you’re lucky.
 From time to time, you can walk around and even sit by the door and get lost in the beauty
 This is why many say that a train ride in Sri Lanka’s hill country is perhaps the most beautiful train journey in the world!
</P2>

<h1>WHERE TO GO IN SRI LANKA</h1>
<p3>the whole country is divided into four zones the beaches, the hill country, the forest and historical places
we suggest every part of the country is pretty but according to the feedbacks more tourists suggest that
the middle part of the country makes them fall in love with sri Lanka</p3>
